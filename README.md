# Versioning
An exploration of how to version rdf graphs.

`versioning.py` contains a crude implementation of how to do version control using rdf-triples (using the vocab in `versioning.ttl`).    

`person_v1.ttl`and `person_v2.ttl` are two versions of the same graph.   

`pretty.py`contains a pretty printer for graphs.   

`sample.py` shows how to tie it all together.   

Have fun!
